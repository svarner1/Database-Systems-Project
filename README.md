# Project Goal
As part of the course Database Systems, our team worked on a semester-long group project to develop a database for a hypothetical system. We created a database for an e-commerce websit using **Postgresql** and **Visual Studio Code**.

# Project Description

Online shopping is very popular, as it allows people to get many choices on a single platform compared to traditional shopping. Because of this, the preference for online shopping is at large scale. The main purpose of this project is to create a database for an alcoholic beverage e-commerce website. The database will store information about the site's products, product categories, customer orders, customers, the website's stock, and brands sold. Some of the entities in our database include "Product," "Order," and "Customer."

# Project Scenario

The database was designed for a startup e-commerce company launching an alcohol-focused online marketplace (similar to Amazon but specialized). Key requirements included:

**User Accounts (Customers)**
Store personal details (name, address, date of birth).
Save payment information for faster checkout.
Maintain past order history with full order details.

**Sellers**

List alcoholic products with name, description, price, image, and seller details.
Track sales and view customer orders.
Products & Categories
Organize products under multiple categories for easier navigation.
Allow customers to view ratings to aid purchasing decisions.

**Shopping Cart & Orders**

Customers add items to an online cart before purchase.
Cart persists until cleared or checkout is complete.
Orders include order ID, product quantities, date, total price, and shipping address.

**Payments**

Verify each payment before shipping.
Track payment type, status, and date.

**Delivery Tracking**

Store and display expected delivery dates.
